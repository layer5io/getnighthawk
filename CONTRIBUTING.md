# <a name="contributing">General Contribution Flow</a>

In order to contribute to Meshery, please follow the fork-and-pull request workflow described [here](./CONTRIBUTING-gitflow.md).

## <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

# <a name="getnighthawk">About GetNightHawk?</a>
GetNighthawk aims to provide generally-available distributions of Nighthawk under different architectures and platforms and easy-to-use tooling for installation and operation. This will include creating distributions of Nighthawk as well as augmenting existing tooling, Meshery, to retrieve these arch-specific packages and update their deployments.


# <a name="contribute">How to Contribute?</a>

# Notes related to Nighthawk [Transform function](https://github.com/layer5io/getnighthawk/blob/d13923e181c6bd8daddacee74d8a8d571658d839/pkg/client/transform.go)
1. The format of results generated by Nighthawk is different than format of Fortio's result, to convert Nighthawk's results into Fortio compatible format we use [transform function](https://github.com/layer5io/getnighthawk/blob/d13923e181c6bd8daddacee74d8a8d571658d839/pkg/client/transform.go#L17), based on the [proto file](https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk/blob/f42add9bb5c71a5652db2f9471dda357b96d5ee2/api/client/transform/fortio.proto#L31).

2. The proto file has discrepancies and is not completely compatible with fortio. 
Check the [issue](https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk/issues/932) and go through comments for clarity.

3. To handle this mismatched types, we have re-implemented [Unmarshall function](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/b3199637ec7a5a25cac476cf1d0d2c474c978c37/server/helpers/load_test_interface.go#L447) to facilitate compatibility.

In case of incompatibility in future, we need to alter the [transorm function](https://github.com/layer5io/getnighthawk/blob/d13923e181c6bd8daddacee74d8a8d571658d839/pkg/client/transform.go) or [Unmarshall function](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/b3199637ec7a5a25cac476cf1d0d2c474c978c37/server/helpers/load_test_interface.go#L447).

*The above Unmarshall function needs to be removed once the [issue](https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk/issues/932) is fixed.*
