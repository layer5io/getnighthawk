# <a name="contributing">Contributing Overview</a>
Please do! Thanks for your help improving the project! :balloon:

All contributors are welcome. Please see the [newcomers welcome guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17OPtDE_rdnPQxmk2Kauhm3GwXF1R5dZ3Cj8qZLKdo5E/edit) for how, where and why to contribute. This project is community-built and welcomes collaboration. Contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](.CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Not sure where to start? First, see the [newcomers welcome guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17OPtDE_rdnPQxmk2Kauhm3GwXF1R5dZ3Cj8qZLKdo5E/edit). Grab an open issue with the [help-wanted label](../../labels/help%20wanted) and jump in. Join the [Slack account](http://slack.layer5.io) and engage in conversation. Create a [new issue](/../../issues/new/choose) if needed.  All [pull requests](/../../pulls) should reference an open [issue](/../../issues). Include keywords in your pull request descriptions, as well as commit messages, to [automatically close issues in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords).

# <a name="contributing">General Contribution Flow</a>

In order to contribute to Meshery, please follow the fork-and-pull request workflow described [here](./CONTRIBUTING-gitflow.md).

## <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

## <a name="contributing-docs">Documentation Contribution Flow</a>
Please contribute! Layer5 documentation uses Jekyll and GitHub Pages to host docs sites. Learn more about [Layer5's documentation framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17guuaxb0xsfutBCzyj2CT6OZiFnMu9w4PzoILXhRXSo/edit?usp=sharing). The process of contributing follows this flow:

1. Create a fork, if you have not already, by following the steps described [here](./CONTRIBUTING-gitflow.md)
1. In the local copy of your fork, navigate to the docs folder.
`cd docs`
1. Create and checkout a new branch to make changes within
`git checkout -b <my-changes>`
1. Edit/add documentation.
`vi <specific page>.md`
1. Run site locally to preview changes.
`make site`
1. Commit, [sign-off](#commit-signing), and push changes to your remote branch.
`git push origin <my-changes>`
1. Open a pull request (in your web browser) against the repo.


#### Tests
Users can now test their code on their local machine against the CI checks implemented using `make run-tests`.

To test code changes on your local machine, run the following command:
```
make run-tests
```

#### Building Docker image
To build a Docker image of the project, please ensure you have `Docker` installed to be able to build the image. Now, run the following command to build the Docker image:
```sh
make docker
```
